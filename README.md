# multiservices_app

MultiServicesApp is a Flutter application that includes everything I’ve learned in Flutter development, combining multiple core features with clean architecture and modern practices.

• Bookly Feature: Displays books from a REST API with advanced filtering.
• News Feature: Shows the latest news with filters for country, language, and category.
• Notes Feature: Lets users create, edit, and delete daily notes stored locally using Hive.
• Real‑Time Chat Feature: Firebase‑based chat with friend requests, chat rooms, and support for messages, files, images, and audio.
• Localization: Supports Arabic and English languages.
• Theming: Offers light and dark mode for improved user experience.

The app is built using MVVM architecture, Repository pattern, and Cubit state management for clean, maintainable, and efficient code.
