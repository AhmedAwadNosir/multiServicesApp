# multiservices_app

**MultiServicesApp** is a Flutter application that includes everything I’ve learned in Flutter development, combining multiple core features with modern practices and clean architecture.

• **📚 Bookly Feature:** Displays books from a REST API with advanced filtering.  
• **📰 News Feature:** Shows the latest news with filters for country, language, and category.  
• **🗒️ Notes Feature:** Lets users create, edit, and delete daily notes stored locally using Hive.  
• **💬 Real‑Time Chat Feature:** Firebase‑based chat with friend requests, chat rooms, and support for text, files, images, and audio.  
• **🌐 Localization:** Supports **Arabic and English** languages.  
• **🌙 Theming:** Offers **light and dark mode** for a better user experience.

The app is built using **MVVM architecture**, **Repository pattern**, and **Cubit state management** for clean, maintainable, and efficient code.
